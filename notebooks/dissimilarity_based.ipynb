    "# Reverse Recommendation for Anomaly Detection with Qdrant\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how fraud detection systems spot suspicious transactions in a sea of normal ones? Let's try to understand how reverse recommendation can help us in finding fraudulent transactions. Detection of fraudulent transactions is very important to safeguard the interests of the customers. In this blog, I'll explain how we can use Qdrant to build a vector store of normal transactions and detect anomalies based on how \"off\" a transaction is from the usual patterns of the customer. We will build a fraud detection system that uses similarity search of Qdrant and checks how far away a new transaction is from the normal transactions in vector space. If the new transaction is far away from the normal transactions, then it is flagged as a fraudulent transaction. We also use a RAG based approach to not only detect the fraudulent transactions but also to explain why a transaction is flagged as fraudulent so that customer-support can take necessary actions. Let's understand how we can build this system in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use reverse recommendations for anomaly detection? Simple: they help spot outliers faster by comparing new transactions against a baseline of normal behavior. Using reverse recommendations we can find most dissimilar entries thereby helping us identify abnormal behavior of the data."
